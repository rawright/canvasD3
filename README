canvasD3 v0.0.4

To do:
- Add function that will draw lines a, b to point c
- Add connect 2 lines to a point with proper angle
- Experiment with 3D by displaying side-by-side canvas elements with
slightly different perspectives of the same thing.
- Add Ant build script
- Qunit tests
- Change stickman.js to return an array of draw instructions rather
than actually drawing on the screen. These can then be reused with
changes to orientation and rotation.

New in v0.0.4
Added stickman.js in order to experiment with using canvasD3.js for
cartoonish annimation in 3D.
Replaced helper_functions.js with util.js.
Replaced my reset with the yui css reset.

New in v0.0.3
Added rotation capabilities for all three plans
To set a rotation call setRotation(x, y, z, xGrads, yGrads, zGrads).
x, y, z define the point to rotate around.
xGrads, yGrads, zGrads specify the rotation in grads along each
axis (400 grads = 2PI or 360 degrees).
